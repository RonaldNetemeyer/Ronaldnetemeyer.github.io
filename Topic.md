# WHAT IS INDESIGN

#### InDesign is a desktop publishing software application for creating flyers, brochures, magazines, newspapers, and books. Projects created using InDesign can be shared in both digital and print formats. InDesign is used by graphic designers, artists, publishers, and marketing professionals. It is developed and produced by Adobe Systems and is available individually, or as part of the Adobe Creative Cloud. InDesign was previously available as part of the Creative Suite.

> Document window (in the middle) displays the file you are currently working on. Multiple open documents appear as tabs in the Document window.

> Menu bar (at the very top) shows the File, Edit, and other menus that give you access to a variety of commands, adjustments, settings, and panels.

> Control panel (under the Menu bar) displays options for the currently selected artwork or tool.

> Tools panel (on the left) contains tools for creating and editing artwork. Similar tools are grouped together. You can access them by clicking and holding a tool in the Tools panel.

> Panels (on the right) include Color, Layers, and other panels that contain a variety of controls for working with documents. You can find a full list of panels under the Window menu.

> The Zoom tool, located in the Tools panel, can be used to show you more detail of a document. To change from Zoom In to Zoom Out, press Alt (Windows) or Option (macOS).

> The Hand tool, also located in the Tools panel, allows you to pan across a document.

> The view menu below the document can be used to change the view of a document.
 
> The tools used to create frames — Type tool, Frame tools, and shape tools — are located in the Tools panel.

> Frames can be created and used as placeholders (a frame without content).

> Text and images in InDesign reside within a frame. When you place images or text in InDesign, a frame is created automatically for that content.

> For text, the frame indicates the area where text is to be shown. Text frames have small boxes in the upper-left and lower-right corners which can be used to connect frames together so text can flow from one frame to another.

> For images, the frame can be used to crop or mask parts of the image.
